Heap abstraction :

record Heap (H : Set → Set) : Set1 where
  field
    empty   : ∀ {A} → H A
    isEmpty : ∀ {A} → H A → Bool

    singleton : ∀ {A} → Priority → A → H A

    merge  : ∀ {A} → H A → H A → H A
    insert : ∀ {A} → Priority → A → H A → H A

    findMin   : ∀ {A} → H A → A
    deleteMin : ∀ {A} → H A → H A

1.1

this paper builds on ideas presented in "Why dependent types matter" and
takes them further by proving WBL Heap

1.2 - contributions

1.3 - assumptions and conventions

convention: in the text I write 0 for zero, 1 for suc zero and so on.
            0 is lowest priority

A good introductory level text on reasoning via. equality is "Agda -
Equality" by Andreas Abel.

I will use "WBL heap" instead of Weight biased leftist heap.

4 basic modules - I assume you know Bool, Nat and Reasining (overview what
is in that module). Ordering uses concept of data as evidence (reference to
why dep types matter). You must understand them before proceeding.

2.0 - properties of heap

present WBL Heaps, mention breefly their properties

we are not interested in isEmpty function - we have pattern matching
on empty constructor

Elements stored by a heap will be completely irrelevant in our proofs,
but we keep them for completeness sake.

give description of two invariants: rank of subtrees and priority in a heap

When we inline definition of makeT in rank proof we need to supply four
proofs instead of 4. Previously there were 2 proofs of makeT and 2 proofs
of merge. New proofs will be a combination of these.

Proofs of makeT:

1) trivial
2) commutativity under suc:

     suc (r + l) ≡ suc (l + r)

   proved as:

     cong suc (+comm r l)

Proofs of merge

1) suc (l1 + (r1 + suc (l2 + r2))) ≡ suc ((l1 + r1) + suc (l2 + r2))

   proved as:

     cong suc (+assoc l1 r1 (suc (l2 + r2)))

   or, after substituting a = l1, b = r1 and c = suc (l2 + r2) as:

     cong suc (+assoc a b c)

2) suc (l2 + (r2 + suc (l1 + r1))) ≡ suc ((l1 + r1) + suc (l2 + r2))

proof-2a l1 r1 l2 r2 =
  cong suc (trans (+assoc l2 r2 (suc (l1 + r1)))
           (trans (sym (+suc (l2 + r2) (l1 + r1)))
           (trans (cong suc (+comm (l2 + r2) (l1 + r1))) (+suc (l1 + r1) (l2 + r2)))))

suc (l2 + (r2 + suc (l1 + r1))) ≡[ cong suc ]
     l2 + (r2 + suc (l1 + r1))  ≡[+assoc l2 r2 (suc (l1 + r1))]
    (l2 + r2) + suc (l1 + r1)   ≡[ sym (+suc (l2 + r2) (l1 + r1))]
    suc ((l2 + r2) + (l1 + r1)) ≡[ cong suc (+comm (l2 + r2) (l1 + r1)) ]
    suc ((l1 + r1) + (l2 + r2)) ≡[+suc (l1 + r1) (l2 + r2) ]
    (l1 + r1) + suc (l2 + r2) ∎

- Note: if we have to prove that a = e, and we can prove that a = b, b = c,
- c = d, d = e, then we can chain proofs using trans:
-
-   trans (a ≡ b) (trans (b ≡ c) (trans (c ≡ d) (d ≡ e)))
-
- We will be using this pattern here. It is verobse and standard library
- provides ≡-Reasoning to perform these kind of proofs.

New proofs will result from combining old ones.

Inlining makeT into :

          = subst (Heap A)
                  (proof-1 l1-rank r1-rank l2-rank r2-rank) -- See [merge, proof 1]
                  (makeT p1 x1 l1 (merge r1 h2))

gives two cases:

1)
          = subst (Heap A)
                  (proof-1 l1-rank r1-rank l2-rank r2-rank) -- See [merge, proof 1]
                  (node l1≥r1+h2 p1 x1 l1 (merge r1 h2))

Here we don't swap subtrees and since the proof of that property is
trivial this proof is identical to the previous one.

2)

          = subst (Heap A)
                  (proof-2 l1-rank r1-rank l2-rank r2-rank) -- See [merge, proof 2]
                  (node l1≤r1+h2 p1 x1 (merge r1 h2) l1)

Here we swap subtrees, which means that new proof will be result of
combining two proofs:

  cong suc (+comm r l)    -- makeT
  cong suc (+assoc a b c) -- proof 1

Property we have to prove now is:

  suc ((r1 + suc (l2 + r2)) + l1) ≡ suc ((l1 + r1) + suc (l2 + r2))

Compared to the previous one l1 and (r1 + suc (l2 + r2)) have been
swapped on the RHS. We only need one cong suc. We start by proving
commutativity and then use the old proof.

  cong suc (trans (+comm (r1 + (suc (l2 + r2))) l1)
                  (+assoc l1 r1 (suc (l2 + r2))))

∎

Now for the second part. Inlining makeT into

          = subst (Heap A)
                  (proof-2 l1-rank r1-rank l2-rank r2-rank) -- See [merge, proof 2]
                  (makeT p2 x2 l2 (merge r2 h1))


gives two cases:

3)
          = subst (Heap A)
                  (proof-3 l1-rank r1-rank l2-rank r2-rank) -- See [merge, proof 3]
                  (node l2≥r2+h1 p2 x2 l2 (merge r2 h1))

Again, we don't swap subtrees and since the proof of that property is
trivial this proof is identical to the previous one.

4) Property to prove:

suc ((r2 + suc (l1 + r1)) + l2) ≡ suc ((l1 + r1) + suc (l2 + r2))


suc (l2 + (r2 + suc (l1 + r1))) ≡ suc ((l1 + r1) + suc (l2 + r2))


          = subst (Heap A)
                  (proof-4 l1-rank r1-rank l2-rank r2-rank) -- See [merge, proof 4]
                  (node l2≤r2+h1 p2 x2 (merge r2 h1) l2)

In this case we swap subtrees, so we combine two proofs:

  cong suc (+comm r l)    -- makeT
  cong suc (trans (+assoc l2 r2 (suc (l1 + r1)))
           (trans (sym (+suc (l2 + r2) (l1 + r1)))
           (trans (cong suc (+comm (l2 + r2) (l1 + r1))) (+suc (l1 + r1) (l2 + r2)))))


Again, we combine both proofs using transitivity:

cong suc (trans (+comm ((r2 + suc (l1 + r1))) l2)
                (lemma-3 l2 r2 (l1 + r1)))

Where lemma-3 proves point 3)
